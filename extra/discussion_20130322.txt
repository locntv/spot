Upload image
============
truong hop upload anh tren mobile do
i think a simple message that says "please upload photo from laptop" would be sufficient



Check in & check out
====================
A user can only check-in to 1 spot. When he checks-in to a new spot, he automatically checks out of previous spots
A user automatically checks out after 4 hours
A user automatically checks out after he is 0.25 miles away from where he checked-in

by the way, one note. When a user checks-in into a venue, please highlight the venue
highlight the venue box in the Spots page, so the user knows which place he is checked in


Domain info
===========
Username: stoplightspot
Password: FIELD3team

Map API
=======
I'd like to enter an address of a venue
so the admin page should allow me to enter name, address


For web-app
=========== 
- When the page is refreshed, we will check user location:
  * For checks-out
    -> after 4 hours <<< Do we need run cron to update user status at venue
    -> 0.1 miles away from where he checked-in
  * For checks-in
    -> only check-in to 1 spot and automatically checks out of previous spots
10min + when user hits refresh on spots page
i think together the user experience should be decent


If there is no spot, the "Spots page" should be empty
if a venue has no user checked-in, it should still show up in the spots page, but show display 0 user checked-in
recall for each venue, it shows the name, address, and # of people checked-in
is this clear?
hi team
please let me know if they are more questions
I also need to sleep, its 1am here :)
for Monday 3/25, we will test the following
• Admins can add venues to the admin webpage
• Users can create profiles.
• Users can check-in to venues (shouldn’t be possible if > 0.1 mile away). 
    o In the spots page, checked-in venue should be highlighted.
    o User can only check-in to one venue. 
• Ratio bubble should accurately reflect # of users (of opposite sex) who are checked-in
• User check-out once they move > 0.1 mile away (and when they check-in somewhere else)
    o User is also check-out automatically after 4 hours. This is to prevent the case that the user just closes the iOS app or native app. 
• User location is updated by hitting refresh + every 10 minutes for both native and iOS app.
